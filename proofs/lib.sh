# The proofs are checked against one pinned toolchain: Agda 2.6.4.3 and
# agda-stdlib 2.1, which are exactly Debian 13 (trixie)'s `agda` and
# `agda-stdlib` packages.  Any other Agda is refused rather than tried, because
# "it type-checked on something" is not the claim being made.  This is the same
# contract as CompositionalDA.jl's and ExactCounts.jl's proofs/lib.sh; the three
# are kept textually close on purpose so a fix to one is a fix to the others.

#                    (default: /usr/share/agda-stdlib/standard-library.agda-lib)
#
# Why /usr/bin/agda is tried BEFORE PATH: a developer machine may carry a newer
# Agda earlier on PATH (this estate does: 2.7.0.1 under tools/provers-solvers).
# Taking "whatever `agda` resolves to" is how a sibling's proofs first came to
# depend on an untagged stdlib development SHA.
