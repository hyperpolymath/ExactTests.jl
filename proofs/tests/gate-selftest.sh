# Prove that the proof gate can fail.
#
# A gate that has never been observed to reject anything is not evidence.  This
# script takes a throwaway copy of the proof tree, breaks it in one specific way
# at a time, and requires the gate to reject it.  If any mutation is *accepted*,
# or if a mutation failed to apply at all, this script exits non-zero.
#
# Three kinds of control:
#   1. planted defects in a theorem — the type-checker must reject them;
#   2. planted defects in the tree's hygiene (a module dropped from the entry
#      point, a postulate, `--safe` removed) — the axiom audit must reject them;
#   3. the standing negative controls in `proofs/agda/reject/` — Agda must
#      reject each one with the exact error its `-- EXPECT:` line names, so that
#      a rejection for the wrong reason (a missing import, say) does not pass
#      for the right one.
# And finally the pristine tree must still be accepted, so that a gate which
# rejects everything cannot pass this test either.
#
# It runs in CI.  A gate whose self-test is skipped is a gate nobody can trust,
# so there is no flag to turn this off.
#
# Usage: proofs/tests/gate-selftest.sh
#
# Toolchain: Debian 13's Agda 2.6.4.3 and agda-stdlib 2.1, resolved by
# proofs/lib.sh (nothing is vendored; an absent or wrong prover is a failure).
